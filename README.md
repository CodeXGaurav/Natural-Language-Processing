# Natural-Language-Processing

### It is not a magic??
#### Let's try to understand.

The concepts is that computers have understanding of Machine level code which are happened to have some vocabulary and highly structured conventions with tons of rules and restriction. The codes written to understand by computer will only run if they are free of syntatic error. Natural Langaugae Processing is a technique in which we give computers ability to understand and do interpretations of human language. There has been various techniques developed to achieve this ability for computer. Mainly supervised(conventional) and unsupervised techniques(relatively new) to understand and comprehend human language which is not structured, have very large and diverse vocabulary , words with several different meanings and all sorts of interesting word play. One of the biggest challenges is to include linguistic pauses for coumpters to comprehend the language.
